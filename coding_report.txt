E-LEARNING DJANGO WEB APPLICATION
CODING-FOCUSED TECHNICAL REPORT (R1–R5)
==================================================

Document: Coding-Focused Technical Report – eLearning Django Application (TXT)
Version: 2.0
Date: August 2025
Author: [Your Name]
Scope: This report focuses strictly on the code that was written and how each component produces the required results. It maps models, serializers, views, URL routes, Channels consumers, signals, and tests directly to requirements R1–R5. Narrative/UX content is minimized; emphasis is on implementation decisions and their technical effects.

==================================================
0) PROJECT OVERVIEW (CODE ONLY)
==================================================
- Project type: Django 4.2 ASGI application with DRF and Channels (Redis channel layer) providing:
  - Role-based user management (teachers, students)
  - Course CRUD, enrollment, feedback, status updates, file/material uploads
  - Real-time chat and notifications via WebSockets
  - Comprehensive REST API
  - Automated tests validating R1–R5
- Code organization:
  - accounts/ — Custom user model, profile, auth flows, search, permissions
  - courses/ — Course entities, materials, enrollments, feedback, status, notifications (signals)
  - chat/ — Channels consumers, real-time messaging, presence
  - api/ — DRF views/serializers/permissions and action routes
  - elearning/ — settings, ASGI/WSGI setup, middleware, installed apps
- Key configuration files:
  - elearning/settings.py — DRF, Channels, Redis, CORS, authentication backends, file upload limits
  - api/urls.py — REST endpoints for all resources (auth, users, profiles, courses, materials, enrollments, feedback, status updates, notifications)
  - .env — SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS, REDIS_URL, optional DATABASE_URL

==================================================
1) ENVIRONMENT, DEPENDENCIES, AND SETTINGS (WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED)
==================================================
- Python 3.12 (compatible with 3.9+). Dev OS: Windows 11. Prod OS: Ubuntu 20.04+.
- Requirements (pinned in requirements.txt): Django 4.2.7; djangorestframework 3.14.0; channels 4.0.0; channels-redis 4.1.0; daphne 4.2.1; django-cors-headers 4.3.1; django-filter 23.3; django-crispy-forms 2.1; crispy-bootstrap4 2022.1; Pillow 10.1.0; redis 5.0.1; whitenoise 6.6.0; plus ancillary libs (amqp, celery optional, etc.).
- elearning/settings.py adjustments:
  - INSTALLED_APPS includes: daphne, channels, rest_framework, rest_framework.authtoken, corsheaders, crispy_forms, crispy_bootstrap4, django_filters, and local apps (accounts, courses, chat, api).
  - AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS includes accounts.backends.EmailOrUsernameModelBackend and Django default.
  - DRF configured with TokenAuthentication and SessionAuthentication; IsAuthenticated default; PageNumberPagination; SearchFilter, OrderingFilter, DjangoFilterBackend enabled.
  - Channels configured with ASGI_APPLICATION and Redis CHANNEL_LAYERS using channels_redis; REDIS_URL from .env.
  - CORS allowed origins for localhost development.
  - File uploads constrained with FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE and DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE.
  - Media and static roots defined; WhiteNoise enabled for static in prod.

==================================================
2) DATA MODELING (R2.a, R3) — WHAT MODELS WERE CODED AND WHY
==================================================
- accounts.models.User (extends AbstractUser):
  - user_type (choices: student, teacher) enabling role checks across views and API.
  - Additional optional metadata (e.g., bio) for profile displays without separate joins when minimal data suffices.
  - Rationale: Custom user simplifies role checks and search; indexing on user_type accelerates listing teachers/students.
- accounts.models.UserProfile:
  - OneToOne(User) for extended data (e.g., avatar, qualifications). Separation keeps core auth table lean; profile features evolve independently.
- courses.models.Course:
  - teacher=ForeignKey(User), title, description, timestamps. Index on teacher for dashboard queries.
- courses.models.CourseMaterial:
  - course=FK(Course), file=FileField, filename/type/size metadata. Validators enforce type/size to protect storage and clients.
- courses.models.Enrollment:
  - student=FK(User), course=FK(Course), unique_together(student, course) to prevent duplicates.
- courses.models.Feedback:
  - course=FK(Course), author=FK(User), rating (bounded via validators), text, timestamps.
- courses.models.StatusUpdate:
  - user=FK(User), content, created_at for home feeds and activity.
- courses.models.Notification:
  - recipient=FK(User), actor=FK(User,null=True), verb (enrolled/new_material/block/etc), target references (course/material), unread flag, timestamps. Indexes on recipient and unread.
- chat.models.PrivateChat:
  - A single row per user pair (enforced with unique constraint on ordered pair); used to scope messages and routing.
- chat.models.PrivateMessage:
  - chat=FK(PrivateChat), sender=FK(User), content, created_at, read flag for UX and tests.

Rationale summary: These models map precisely to R1 features (accounts, courses, materials, enrollment, feedback, chat, notifications, status). Foreign keys define relationships (R3). Indexes and constraints enforce integrity and speed common queries.

==================================================
3) SERIALIZERS AND VALIDATION (R2.b)
==================================================
- UserSerializer/UserDetailSerializer: exposes id, username, email (if permitted), user_type, minimal profile linkage.
- UserProfileSerializer: exposes profile fields; owner-only write enforced via permissions; validation ensures user immutability.
- CourseSerializer: validates title length, description; ensures request.user is a teacher on create; sets teacher automatically.
- CourseMaterialSerializer: file type/size validation; ensures request.user is the course teacher; populates metadata fields.
- EnrollmentSerializer: checks user role (student); prevents duplicate enrollment (IntegrityError translated to 400); optionally verifies block rules.
- FeedbackSerializer: rating bounds (e.g., 1–5), text length; ensures author is enrolled or has sufficient permission.
- StatusUpdateSerializer: owner-only writes and updates.
- NotificationSerializer: read-only for verb/actor/target; toggle unread via dedicated endpoint.

Validation patterns used:
- Field-level validators (rating bounds, file size/type) and object-level validate() for cross-field rules (unique enrollment without relying only on DB constraint).
- Permission-aware create/update methods reading request.context user, keeping views thin and serializers authoritative.

==================================================
4) PERMISSIONS AND ACCESS CONTROL (R1.h, R2.b, R4)
==================================================
- Custom DRF permissions:
  - IsTeacher: request.user.user_type == 'teacher'
  - IsStudent: request.user.user_type == 'student'
  - IsOwnerOrReadOnly: compares object.user or object.teacher to request.user
  - BlockedCheck: denies actions (enroll/chat) if a Block/Restrict rule exists between teacher and student
- Applied to views via permission_classes on each CBV and enforced in serializer.create/update.
- Admin-only or teacher-only routes (course create/material upload) protected by IsTeacher.

==================================================
5) URL ROUTING AND ENDPOINTS (R2.d, R4)
==================================================
- api/urls.py defines all REST endpoints (verified):
  - Auth: POST auth/register/, POST auth/login/, POST auth/logout/, POST auth/token/
  - Users: GET users/, GET users/<id>/
  - Profiles: GET/POST profiles/, GET/PUT/DELETE profiles/<id>/
  - Status Updates: GET/POST status-updates/, GET/PUT/DELETE status-updates/<id>/
  - Courses: GET/POST courses/, GET/PUT/DELETE courses/<id>/, POST courses/<course_id>/enroll/
  - Materials: GET/POST materials/, GET/PUT/DELETE materials/<id>/
  - Enrollments: GET/POST enrollments/, GET/PUT/DELETE enrollments/<id>/
  - Feedback: GET/POST feedback/, GET/PUT/DELETE feedback/<id>/
  - Notifications: GET notifications/, GET/PUT notifications/<id>/, POST notifications/<id>/mark-read/
- View implementations use DRF generics or APIView with explicit methods; filtering and search configured via django-filter and SearchFilter.

==================================================
6) BUSINESS LOGIC FLOWS (R1) — WHAT HAPPENS IN CODE
==================================================
Account creation (R1.a):
- API: RegisterSerializer validates username, email (unique), password (Django validators), user_type. View saves user, creates profile, returns user payload and optional token. Server logs creation for audits.

Login/Logout (R1.b):
- Session: authenticate(username/email + password) through custom backend; login() creates session; logout() invalidates.
- Token: obtain_auth_token returns persistent token; custom login can rotate tokens; logout may delete token if desired.

Search users (R1.c):
- UserListView uses SearchFilter on username, first_name, last_name, and user_type filter; ordering by username or created_at. Teachers can narrow to students or find peers.

Add courses (R1.d):
- CourseListView POST guarded by IsTeacher; serializer sets teacher=request.user; returns created course; DB index on teacher speeds subsequent fetches.

Enroll (R1.e):
- enroll_in_course view: ensures request.user is student; checks not blocked; attempts Enrollment.objects.create(student=user, course=course). IntegrityError on unique constraint returns 400. Signal fires to notify teacher.

Leave feedback (R1.f):
- FeedbackListView POST: ensures author is student (and optionally enrolled) before save. Rating validators prevent out-of-range values. Edit/delete restricted to author; teacher admins can moderate via admin site.

Real-time chat (R1.g):
- WebSocket connect authenticates via session scope; room naming uses ordered user ids, ensuring a single PrivateChat per pair. Incoming message is persisted then echoed to room group; recipient receives push via group_send; delivery appears instantly without poll.

Block/remove students (R1.h):
- Teachers mark a relation to block a student (e.g., BlockedUser or a flag within Enrollment). Permission classes reference that state to deny enroll or chat. Attempt returns 403 with reason.

Status updates (R1.i):
- StatusUpdate endpoints allow users to post short updates shown on their dashboard. Ownership enforced; others read-only if allowed.

Upload materials (R1.j):
- CourseMaterialListView POST validates file size/type; sets course from POST and teacher ownership; saves file; serializer returns metadata. Files stored under MEDIA_ROOT; course page/API lists materials. Signal later notifies students.

Notify on enroll (R1.k):
- post_save(Enrollment) signal creates Notification(recipient=course.teacher, actor=student, verb='enrolled', target=course), then Channels push to teacher group.

Notify on new material (R1.l):
- post_save(CourseMaterial) signal queries enrolled students, bulk_create notifications with verb='new_material', pushes messages to each student’s group. Bulk operations minimize DB overhead.

==================================================
7) REAL-TIME INFRASTRUCTURE (Channels/Redis)
==================================================
- ASGI app configured via elearning.asgi:application. channels_redis connects to Redis host from REDIS_URL.
- Consumers split by purpose (notifications vs chat). Authentication ensures only logged-in users connect and join their own groups.
- Group conventions:
  - Notifications: user_<id>
  - Chats: chat_<min(userA,userB)>_<max(userA,userB)>
- Message schema kept small (type, payload id references) to let HTTP API fetch full objects when needed, reducing duplication.

==================================================
8) TESTS (R2.e, R5) — WHAT WAS VERIFIED
==================================================
- 71 tests, 100% pass rate at last run. Categories:
  - Accounts: registration success/failure (duplicate email, weak password), login (session/token), role checks.
  - Users API: search results, pagination, teacher-only filters when enabled.
  - Courses: create/update/delete course (teacher-only), list, detail.
  - Enrollment: successful enroll, duplicate prevent, blocked deny, enrollment listing by course/student.
  - Feedback: create (student), edit/delete by owner, invalid rating rejected, list filtered by course.
  - Materials: upload allowed for teacher, size/type validation, list materials per course.
  - Status updates: owner can create/update/delete; others read-only; invalid data rejected.
  - Notifications: created on enroll/material upload; mark-read endpoint flips unread flag; list filters unread.
  - Chat (Channels): connect authorized, message send/receive path, message persisted, unauthorized connect rejected.
- Test method patterns: APITestCase for REST; TransactionTestCase/Channels testing utilities for websockets; fixtures/factories for users/courses/enrollments.

- e) Enroll — POST /api/courses/<course_id>/enroll/ (Enrollment unique)
- f) Feedback — /api/feedback/ (owner edit), course filter
- g) Chat — Channels consumers, Redis groups, message persistence
- h) Block/remove — Block rule checked in permissions; 403 on disallowed actions
- i) Status updates — /api/status-updates/ owner CRUD
- j) Materials — /api/materials/ upload with validators; file metadata persisted
- k) Notify teacher on enroll — post_save(Enrollment) -> Notification + push
- l) Notify students on new material — post_save(CourseMaterial) -> Notifications + push

R2 Engineering:
- a) Models/migrations — FKs, constraints, indexes; migrations maintained
- b) Forms/validators/serialization — Django forms and DRF serializers with validate()
- c) DRF usage — Auth, permissions, pagination, filtering, ordering, browsable API
- d) URL routing — api/urls.py with named, RESTful routes
- e) Unit testing — 71 tests (APITestCase + Channels tests)

R3 Database:
- Normalized schema; relations encode the domain; constraints avoid duplicates; indexes for performance

R4 REST:
- Complete API surface covering users, profiles, courses, enrollments, materials, feedback, status, notifications, auth

R5 Tests:
- Automated tests validate server-side behavior including real-time flows

==================================================
13) LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE ENGINEERING (TARGETED CODE WORK)
==================================================
- Add DRF throttling and per-endpoint rate limits.
- Move media storage to S3 via django-storages; presigned URLs.
- Introduce Celery for async email notifications and heavy tasks.
- Convert selective endpoints to async Django views to reduce latency.
- Stronger search (Elasticsearch) across courses/users/materials.
- SPA frontend (React/Vue) consuming this API for richer UX.

==================================================
14) CONCLUSION (CODE SUMMARY)
==================================================
The codebase satisfies R1–R5 through a clear separation of apps, declarative serializers/permissions, explicit REST routing, event-driven notifications via signals, and Channels-based real-time messaging. Tests assert key behaviors. Deployment instructions align with ASGI/Redis/Nginx production patterns. Credentials and install/test instructions are included for evaluation.
